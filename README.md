# ajhresume

A judicious, hard-working resume document class based on `memoir`.


## Installation

TODO


### Dependencies

The following packages are required for `ajhresume`: `longtable`, `tabularx`,
`lastpage`, `booktabs`, `calc`, `xcolor`, `mdwlist`, `hyperref`

The `texfot` and `latexmk` utilities are part of the build process. They are
included with `texlive-core` on Arch Linux, and are generally part of any sane
distribution of \LaTeX.


## Documentation

The class documentation can be found on
[CTAN](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/ajhresume/ajhresume.pdf).
This document can be generated by running `make` inside the repository, or by
running `pdflatex ajhresume.dtx`.


## Examples

This package allows you to generate an example resume, `example.tex`. It is
explained in detail in the [manual for the class][1] as well as [uploaded to
CTAN in `.tex`][2] and [`.pdf`][3] format. Useful comments are included and the
template is suitable as a starting point for your resume.
