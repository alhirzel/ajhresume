# ajhresume

A judicious, hard-working resume document class based on `memoir`.

This document class includes a pre-formatted header and a number of handy
environments for laying out a resume. An example is provided demonstrating the
most useful features of this class. Starting from the example you can create
your own resume easily. Note that while this class is oriented toward the
creation of resumes, CVs are also possible.


## Installation

TODO


### Dependencies

The following packages are required for `ajhresume`: `longtable`, `tabularx`,
`lastpage`, `booktabs`, `calc`, `xcolor`, `mdwlist`, `hyperref`

The `texfot` and `latexmk` utilities are part of the build process. They are
included with `texlive-core` on Arch Linux, and are generally part of any sane
distribution of \LaTeX.


## Documentation

The class documentation can be found on
[CTAN](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/ajhresume/ajhresume.pdf).
This document can be generated by running `make` inside the repository, or by
running `pdflatex ajhresume.dtx`.


## Examples

This package allows you to generate an example resume, `example.tex`. It is
explained in detail in the [manual for the class][1] as well as [uploaded to
CTAN in `.tex`][2] and [`.pdf`][3] format. Useful comments are included and the
template is suitable as a starting point for your resume.
